# MicroSite
Created because other frontend design websites (eg. jsfiddle) didn't include a file system leading to (IMO) disgusting code. 
Visit [here](microsite5.pages.dev). **WARNING: ALPHA VERSION**
## Features
* A fully functioning file system
* A preview system to view your code as if it were a statically hosted website.
* Full codemirror editor
* Autosave and persistent data
  
## Notes
* To add files inside folders please enter `folderName/fileName.{html|js|css}`.
